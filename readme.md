# EngiGraph
### ! This project is in active development !

### Application
The vision of EngiGraph is to create an intuitive node-based interface to allow non-programmers
to set up and visualize complex multi-dynamics simulations.

## Framework
EngiGraph is also just a collection of useful utilities, state-of-the-art and novel simulation algorithms, and libraries.
This makes it a suitable environment for standalone applications/demos as well, for games, simulations, and other computer graphics applications.
